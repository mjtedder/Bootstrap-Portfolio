          <p>Hajimemashite! Nice to meet you. My name is Matt Tedder, and I assume you are reading this to get some insight into who I am. I'm just like you, drifting through life trying to figure everything out. While experiencing this thing called life,
          I was presented the opportunity to live in Japan for a few years. This was a blessing that took everything I thought I knew about life and turned it upside down. I am so grateful for this because it allowed me to be a more understanding, open-minded,
          and empathetic person.</p>
          <p>Now into my thirties, I am ready to stop pretending I enjoy where I work and pursue something I have always been fascinated with since a young age: technology! Hurling into existence in 1987, I am in a unique space to know what it was like before
            we were hit by the Internet, yet still young enough to fully embrace/appreciate it. Even today I still have to stop and marvel at what we humans have been able to create with our brains. Well, I guess that is all on me for now, thanks for reading!</p>
